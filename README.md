# Median of Means Estimator
 
In this mini-project I experimented with various mean estimators. Specifically, I compared the arithmetic mean with
the Median of Means estimator. This estimator splits the data sample in k blocks of m observations, computes the mean
of each block and finally outputs the median of all block-means. I summarized my insights in this blog post.
